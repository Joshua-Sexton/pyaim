* Prune points
* Update for correlated cases, true correlation not DFT
* Allow UHF and GHF and ECP
* Merge all
* Be carefully with symm, for example when diagonalizing the NADO or DAFH
* In complex C routines for rho, check when conj is needed and when not
* Add XDM and post VV10 dispersion

####### Not working when linar dependency !!!

In AOM in case of CASSCF there should be one way to calculate the overlap
integrals over a defined set of canonical
