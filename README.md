# pyaim
A QTAIM/IQA code written in C/Python and interfaced with pyscf

The idea is to upload the code step by step, writting tests and carefully debugging all pieces of the code. Thus this repo is still under heavy development. 

Still very experimental, the surface is finished and agree with our promolden code

All users interested in collaborations are well received

* Surf,basin and aom done and agree with old promolden
