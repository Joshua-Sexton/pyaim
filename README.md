# pyaim
A QTAIM/IQA code written in C/Python and interfaced with pyscf

The idea is to upload the code step by step, writting tests and carefully debugging all pieces of the code. Thus this repo is still under heavy development. 

Actual done work are stored by the moment in the dev branch

All users interested in collaborations are well received
